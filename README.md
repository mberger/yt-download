# yt-download


These python scripts will download either single videos or all videos in a playlist.


Individual Video

```python
python ytdl.py
```


Playlist

```python
python ytdl-playist.py
```


Note: there is a problem with these if they are age protected. You will get an error.


For the ytdl2.py file, you will also need to install ffmpeg.


```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
